### Hi there 👋

Software Engineer, I design, develop, and deploy solutions for customers across various industries, such as energy, travel, banking service, and space. 

React, Spring, and API development user.

Passionate about the code everyday, always open-minded, constructive, and collaborative. Tech watcher, I love sharing my work, always attentive to look for the next challenge or opportunity on my developer journey. 

Otherwise I enjoy hiking 🥾, photography 📸, and playing piano 🎹 in my spare time.

Julien.
